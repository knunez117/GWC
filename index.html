<h2>About Me:</h2>
<p id= "bio">Hi there! I am a stationary aficionada who loves note taking and making every note I take as extra as possible. I love being creative in my everyday life and note taking is the perfect place to let my creativity flow. I discovered the Studygram and Studyblr communities during my freshman year of high school and I was inspired to try new formating for my notes and also developed a love for calligraphy and lettering! Just like I was inspired by others, I hope I can inspire you!</p>
<h2>Hobbies:</h2>
<p id= "moreAboutMe"> In addition to note taking, I love the outdoors and sports. My favorie sport is definitely running! I became involved in running after joining cross country my frehsman year of high school, and later joining track and field. Running helps me release stress, which is definitely much needed as school can get pretty overwhelming sometimes. Running is awesome as it not only helps me clear my mind, but also helps me stay fit and active; Its important to have outlets were you can relax but also be productive!</p>
